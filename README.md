# Chess for Java
I created a two-player Chess game as a part of a Programming course. Our objective was to develop and test a bug-free standalone game in Java, complete with a GUI and game logic components.

# Technology
This game is built using Java. It uses custom drawing for game components and self-programmed logic for checkmate detection. The code is modular, standalone and object oriented, which was a grading criteria for the assignment.
